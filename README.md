Kito is a high-performance backend web framework for TypeScript, written in Rust. It offers an end-to-end type-safe API inspired by **ExpressJS** with optional **tRPC** capabilities. Kito is designed for developers who value performance, simplicity, and flexibility.

```typescript
import { server } from "kitojs"

const app = server();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, world!");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance

Kito is **the fastest backend framework** in the JavaScript ecosystem. By leveraging the performance of **Rust**, Kito outperforms traditional frameworks like Express by an incredible margin. To put it in perspective: **Kito is +1400% (x15) faster than Express**.

> **Req/s**: Higher is better.  
> **Latency**: Lower is better.

Kito's impressive speed stems from a Rust core that minimizes JavaScript's inherent performance limitations, making it ideal for demanding applications that require **exceptional speed and scalability**. *See more benchmarks [here](./bench).*
